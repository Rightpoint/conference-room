The goal of this repository is to provide an initial starting point for building a HTML/CSS/JS rich client application with Angular and Typescript, using a gulp-based build system.

Right now, the basics are working, but not much more (see project issues).  My hope is to evolve this a bit and use it as the starting point for all the future apps of this style I build.  If it's useful to others too, well, that's great.
